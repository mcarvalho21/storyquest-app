# Template Selection for Children's Storytelling Web App

After analyzing the requirements for the children's storytelling web application, I've determined that the **Flask Application Template** is the most appropriate choice for this project.

## Rationale for Selecting Flask Template

1. **Backend/Database Requirements**:
   - The app requires user authentication for saving progress
   - We need to store user stories, progress, and account information
   - The app needs server-side processing for story generation and management

2. **Key Features Requiring Backend Support**:
   - Progress saving and resuming functionality
   - User accounts and authentication
   - Story data persistence
   - Collaborative storytelling features
   - Content management for story elements

3. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Flask provides a lightweight but powerful framework for our needs
   - The built-in support for MySQL database will handle our data storage requirements
   - The template's structure supports our modular development approach

## Project Structure Plan

Using the Flask template, our project will be organized as follows:

```
storytelling_app/
├── venv/                      # Virtual environment
├── src/
│   ├── models/                # Database models for users, stories, elements
│   ├── routes/                # API endpoints and page routes
│   ├── static/                # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
│   │   ├── css/               # Stylesheets
│   │   ├── js/                # JavaScript files
│   │   ├── images/            # Image assets
│   │   └── audio/             # Audio files for narration
│   ├── templates/             # HTML templates
│   │   ├── auth/              # Authentication pages
│   │   ├── stories/           # Story creation and viewing pages
│   │   ├── dashboard/         # User dashboard pages
│   │   └── shared/            # Shared template components
│   └── main.py                # Application entry point
└── requirements.txt           # Project dependencies
```

This structure will support all the required features while maintaining a clean, organized codebase that follows best practices for Flask applications.
