  - Relationships with characters, settings, elements
  - Story sharing status changes
  - Age-appropriate content validation

- **Character Model**
  - Character creation with valid/invalid data
  - Character trait validation
  - Relationship with stories

- **Setting Model**
  - Setting creation with valid/invalid data

- Mobile layout (375x667)
- Navigation menu behavior across devices
- Content scaling and readability

#### User Interactions
- Form validations
- Interactive storytelling elements
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Modal dialogs and popups

### 4. End-to-End Tests
Complete user journeys through the application.

#### User Journeys
- New user registration to story completion
- Returning user login to resume progress
- Story sharing and social features
- Achievement collection
- Weekly challenge participation

#### Cross-browser Testing
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### 5. Performance Tests
Tests for application performance and load handling.

#### Load Testing
- Multiple concurrent users
- Database query optimization
- Response time under load

#### Resource Usage
- Memory consumption
- CPU utilization
- Database connection management

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Tools and Frameworks
- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **Selenium**: UI and end-to-end testing
- **Flask Test Client**: API and route testing
- **Coverage.py**: Test coverage reporting

### Test Organization
- Tests will be organized by feature and test type
- Each test file will focus on a specific component or feature
- Fixtures will be centralized in conftest.py
- Helper functions will be extracted to utils modules

### Continuous Integration
- All tests will run automatically on code changes
- Test coverage reports will be generated
- Failed tests will block merges to main branch

## Test Coverage Goals
- Minimum 90% code coverage for critical paths
- 100% coverage for authentication and data models
- All user-facing features must have UI tests
- All API endpoints must have integration tests

## Regression Testing Strategy
- All tests will run on each code change
- Specific regression tests for previously fixed bugs
- Data-driven tests with consistent test data

## Test Maintenance
- Regular review and update of tests
- Removal of obsolete tests
- Documentation of test purpose and coverage
- Version control for test code and test data

## Reporting
- Detailed test reports with pass/fail status
- Coverage reports highlighting untested code
- Visual diff reports for UI tests
- Performance benchmark reports

## Implementation Timeline
1. Complete unit tests for all models
2. Implement integration tests for all routes
3. Develop UI tests for all pages and responsive layouts
4. Create end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
5. Set up continuous integration and reporting

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass consistently
- Minimum coverage goals are met
- Tests run efficiently (under 5 minutes for the full suite)
- No regressions in existing functionality
- All edge cases are covered
