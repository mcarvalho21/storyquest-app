# StoryQuest Landing Page Redesign Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for redesigning the StoryQuest homepage to align with the 13 commercial landing page best practices provided by the user. The redesign will transform the current educational-focused page into a more conversion-oriented landing page while maintaining the child-friendly and educational essence of the product.

## Current Homepage Analysis
The current homepage has several good elements but lacks the conversion focus and structure of an ideal commercial landing page:

**Strengths:**
- Good visual elements and child-friendly design
- Clear sections for features and benefits
- Age-specific information
- Testimonials from both parents and children
- Basic call-to-action elements

**Weaknesses:**
- Headline is generic rather than value-proposition focused
- No clear subheadline supporting the main headline
- CTAs not visually prominent enough
- Lacks trust indicators and credibility elements
- No urgency or scarcity elements
- Missing clear visual hierarchy to guide user attention
- Social proof not prominently featured
- No conversion form above the fold

## Mapping Guidelines to New Design Elements
